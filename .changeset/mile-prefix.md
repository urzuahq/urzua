# Record types can now declare a shorter filename prefix

`RecordTypeConfig` gains an optional `prefix` field, decoupling a type's filename/ID prefix from
its own name -- the same way `dir` already decouples the type name from its directory. Omitted, a
type's prefix still defaults to its name upper-cased (no change for existing configs).

This repo's own `milestone` type now declares `prefix = "MILE"`: `urzua new milestone "..."` still
takes the same argument and `docs/milestones/` is still the directory, but new records are named
`MILE-N-slug.md` instead of `MILESTONE-N-slug.md`. All 36 existing milestone records were renamed
to match, with cross-references updated.
