# `check` and `audit` emit the declared `scope.source` value, not a Rust `Debug` rendering

`scope.source` came back as `"GitTracked"` — the `Debug` rendering of an internal enum, a value that
appears in no specification. SPEC-2 declares four values for this field, and **no run ever produced
one of them.** An agent branching on `scope.source == "tracked-sweep"`, exactly as the spec
documents, took the wrong branch on every invocation.

It now emits `"tracked-sweep"`.

The field is a serde-renamed enum rather than a `String`, so renaming an internal type can no longer
change published output silently. Only values the tool can actually emit exist on that enum — SPEC-2's
table now marks which of its four declared values a run produces today, so a consumer is not misled
into branching on a mode that isn't built.

**Breaking** for any consumer matching the old `"GitTracked"` string. Nothing could have matched it
correctly against the documented contract, since it was never a documented value.
