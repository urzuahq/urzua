# Fix: `check <path>` now actually scopes to `<path>`

`urzua check docs/adr/` previously examined the entire corpus regardless of the path given --
`paths` was used only to locate the repository root, never to filter what got checked. Fixed:
`check` now genuinely restricts examination to files under the requested path(s). No CLI syntax
change; results narrow correctly for the first time.

Also fixed: record identifiers no longer require exactly 4 digits in the filename, and reference
matching (`Implements`/`Derives-from`/`Supersedes`) now compares by numeric value, so `ADR-0034`
and a hand-typed `ADR-34` resolve to the same record regardless of padding.
